# Axiad

Axiad enables customers to move to a passwordless future without the friction and risk of fragmented solutions. By addressing authentication holistically, regardless of underlying IT complexity, organizations can vastly improve their cybersecurity posture.

Please refer to our website for more information about [Axiad](https://www.axiad.com/).

## Axiad SCIM Connector

Axiad SCIM Connector enables automatic provisioning of users and groups between Axiad Cloud and ForgeRock using the secure and standard protocol, System for Cross-Domain Identity Management(SCIM). The Axiad SCIM connector allows partners to leverage certificate based authentication, which is the most secure, phishing-resistant form of multi-factor authentication (MFA) and is being increasingly deployed in enterprises as well as the public sector. Many enterprise employees, as well as the majority of federal agencies and defense employees/contractors, use a strong authenticator such as a smart card or hardware device for authentication. CBA streamlines the process of authenticating users with a variety of authenticators while improving overall protection.

Axiad provides this SCIM Connector as a starting point for integrating ForgeRock and Axiad Cloud. Since every ForgeRock implementation is different we have provided a basic mapping of ForgeRock attributes for SCIM provisioning. Your organization's implementation may have differences which will require updates to ensure the SCIM Connector works properly.

Your Axiad SCIM Connector may also not require all the attributes that are described below or your ForgeRock implementation may not have all the data populated for all attributes listed. The SCIM attribute mapping will need to be updated as appropriate for your data and business requirements. 

Please work with [Axiad Customer Success](mailto:customer.success@axiad.com) before implementing a SCIM connector as they will need to provide an attribute list and credentials for your Axiad Cloud tenant.

## Prerequisites

1. ForgeRock Identity Management (OpenIDM) 7.3.0 or above
1. Axiad Cloud tenant
1. Axiad Cloud tenant available attribute list

## Axiad Configuration

If your Axiad Cloud tenant is already configured with the required mappings attribute there is no additional Axiad configuration needed. If assistance is needed with your Axiad Cloud environment in the following sections please contact [Axiad Customer Success](mailto:customer.success@axiad.com).

## Configuring the Axiad SCIM Connector

1. Download the latest SCIM Connector configuration and mapping file from [here](https://github.com/kthakur23/axiad-scim/tree/main/config). If assistance is needed, please contact [Axiad Customer Success](mailto:customer.success@axiad.com) team.
2. Copy the `provisioner.openicf-AxiadSCIMConnector.json` file into the `conf` directory where ForgeRock Identity Management is deployed.
3. If the `sync.json` file exist into `conf` directory, copy the contents of `mapping-AxiadSCIMConnector.json` in the mappings array inside the `conf\sync.json` file. If the `sync.json` file doesn't exist, copy the sync.json file in the `conf` directory where ForgeRock Identity Management is deployed.

## ForgeRock Configuration

### 1. Axiad SCIM Connector Configuration

1. Log into the ForgeRock Identity Management console
